### How to use: </br>
Insert a text value, it can be the name of an item you recently bought or a bill that you had to pay. Then, type an amount you want to track, whether you got it or spent it. Make sure to type a dash before the number to make sure the value will be taken as negative if you want to track an expense. If you don't type a dash, the amount will be positive and then added to your income.
